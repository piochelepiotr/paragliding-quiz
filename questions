### 1.
You have launched and are flying away from the hill in smooth air with the brake position at trim when you notice you are not making headway over the ground. You should be concerned about stalling.

- a. True, because you can stall, regardless of brake position  
- b. True, because when your ground speed is slow you are close to stalling  
- c. False, because it is only your ground speed that is low  
- d. False, because modern canopies do not stall  

### 2.
Would you be wise to use your speed bar if you are coming in to land and you are not making forward progress across the ground?  
**(choose all that apply)**

- a. Yes, there is no reason not to. Positive ground speed is the most important thing.  
- b. Generally no because fundamentally, gliders are more prone to deflation and slower to recover when speed bar is engaged. Because you are low, you can’t risk deflation. Accept the negative ground speed and disable the glider quickly after safely landing into the wind.  
- c. If you are being blown backward toward any imminent hazard then consider pushing some amount of speed bar to provide a wider safety margin from the hazard.
