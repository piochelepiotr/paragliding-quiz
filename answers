### 1.
**Answer: c. False, because it is only your ground speed that is low**

Ground speed and airspeed are different. Low ground speed due to headwind doesn't necessarily mean you're close to stalling if your airspeed is maintained at trim.

### 2.
**Answer: b, c**

- b. Generally no because fundamentally, gliders are more prone to deflation and slower to recover when speed bar is engaged. Because you are low, you can't risk deflation. Accept the negative ground speed and disable the glider quickly after safely landing into the wind
- c. If you are being blown backward toward any imminent hazard then consider pushing some amount of speed bar to provide a wider safety margin from the hazard

### 3.
**Answer: b, c**

- b. Are qualified to fly solo, without direct instructor supervision, within significant operating limitations

### 6.
**Answer: c, d, e**

- c. The wing closer to the hill has the right of way
- d. You should alter course to the right
- e. Right of way rules are the best guideline but all situations are unique and not all pilots honor the rules in all situations; be flexible when the situation dictates

### 7.
**Answer: b, c, d**

- b. All pilots should circle the same way
- c. The first pilot in the thermal determines the direction of circling
- d. The higher pilot has the right of way

- a. A prolonged, spiral turn can lead to excessive speed
- b. A deep input the glider may cause a spin
- c. You may drift downwind into the hill
- d. You may become dizzy and disoriented

### 11.
**Answer: c. The amount of rotations doesn't matter. It depends on altitude above ground, and/or if there is any feeling of blacking out from the pilot**

The decision to deploy reserve depends on altitude and pilot condition, not number of rotations.

### 12.
**Answer: b. The canopy design has undergone a specific set of tests designed to measure flight characteristics which could be good for beginners or exclusively for competition pilots depending on the certification level**

Certification means the canopy has been tested for specific flight characteristics, not that it's safe in all conditions.

### 13.
**Answer: b. Move away from the hill and resist the temptation to slow down**

High ground speed in crosswind requires moving away from the hill rather than slowing down.

### 14.
**Answer: b. The pilot in flying gear including the harness weight; the wing is not included**

EN weight range includes pilot and gear but not the wing weight.

- c. There could be severe turbulence directly out in front of launch

### 17.
**Answer: d. Some number of hours of total ultraviolet exposure that depends on the intensity of the radiation and the original quality and construction of the fabric**

UV degradation depends on multiple factors including radiation intensity and fabric quality.

### 18.
**Answer: b, c, d**

- b. Consciously avoid fixating on the hazard (focusing on a hazard has a tendency to interfere with flying away from it)
- c. Maintain awareness of airspeed at all times
- d. Look in the direction you are planning to land and in the direction of your turns prior to turning

### 19.
**Answer: c. A specific set of high wind launch skills**

**Answer: a, e**

- a. Maintain a safe heading with weight shift and/or opposite brake for directional control, and avoid over-controlling
- e. Release the speed bar, if engaged, to return the glider to its best possible setting for recovery

### 25.
**Answer: c, d**

- c. Maintain heading control, then try to clear the stuck tip with brake and/or the stabilo line
- d. If the glider is spiraling as a result and/or if you have riser twist, you may need to throw your reserve

### 26.
**Answer: b. Travel further and be in the air a shorter amount of time**

Flying with full speed bar increases ground speed but reduces time aloft due to higher sink rate.

### 27.
**Answer: c. Travel a shorter distance but be in the air longer**

Flying at minimum sink speed optimizes for staying aloft longer rather than covering distance efficiently.

### 28.
**Answer: b, c, d**

- b. In a spin, one wing is stalled rotating in a negative (backward) direction
- c. In a spiral, both sides of the glider are flying in a positive (forward) direction  
- d. Altitude loss is usually higher in a spin

### 29.
**Answer: d. A combination of both weight shift and progressive brake applications will result in better coordinated turns and smoother flying**

Coordinated turns require both weight shift and progressive brake input for optimal control.

### 30.
**Answer: a, b, c, d**

- a. Asymmetric deflations are more common and tend to be more violent
- b. These gliders are more sensitive to control inputs and can spin easier
- c. These gliders often come up very fast and are harder to launch
- d. These gliders tend to surge further and faster

### 31.
**Answer: a. The force of wind is calculated by the square of the wind speed. So a wind of 5 MPH would have a force of 5 squared (5 x 5) or 25. A 10 MPH wind will have a force of 100**

Wind force increases exponentially with wind speed.

### 32.
**Answer: a. Slowly in lift and quickly in sink**

### 36.
**Answer: b, c**

- b. Conditions might be in the process of changing and this would indicate a bad time to take off
- c. You could be standing in rotor

### 37.
**Answer: a, b, c**

- a. Thermals could be weak or difficult to stay in
- b. Wind speed and direction could be different below the haze layer than above
- c. There could be turbulence at the boundary between the upper and lower layer

### 38.
**Answer: c. After launching and establishing a sensible heading, in smooth air using a technique whereby you can maintain a positive connection with the glider throughout the process**

Getting seated should be done after launch when conditions are stable and controlled.

### 39.
**Answer: d. Get upright in your harness and after flaring hard to minimize ground speed, run fast or skid to a stop if terrain allows while trying to avoid landing on the harness**

**Answer: b, d**

- b. You are caught in strong rotor behind a mountain and are rapidly descending
- d. You are in a spiral and start to feel lightheaded and think you may blackout

### 44.
**Answer: a, b, d**

- a. Come in high over your LZ and do a one or more 360 turn/s (more than one if there is adequate altitude) to determine your drift
- b. Spit and watch which way it drifts on the way down
- d. If there is a body of water near the LZ, looking at the water, the wind shadow will be at the upwind end. This will help you assess the wind direction

### 45.
**Answer: b. Search early for a dense soft tree or bush, try to approach it so that your wing keeps you can avoid falling to the ground. In other words, try to navigate and manage your glider after touchdown such that the glider catches in the tree while keeping your legs together and protecting your face**

Tree landings should be planned to use the tree as a safety buffer.

These are the minimum requirements for Class E airspace below 10,000 feet MSL.

### 58.
**Answer: b. False**

TFRs apply to all aircraft including ultralights, hang gliders, and paragliders.

### 59.
**Answer: c. Some amount of speed bar**

Using speed bar helps penetrate upwind more effectively.

### 60.
**Answer: b. Weight shift and add brake input in the direction you want to turn while keeping some pressure in the opposite brake**

Coordinated turns into thermals require both weight shift and brake input.

### 61.
**Answer: b, c**

- b. The speed will slow and the sink rate will increase
- c. The glider will be closer to stall

### 62.
**Answer: a, c**

- a. Have a slower airspeed with a faster descent rate
- c. Only be steerable with weight shift because the hands will need to hold the big ears to keep them engaged

### 63.
**Answer: c. Looking all around you to ensure a safe turn is possible prior to the turn being initiated**

Clearing a turn requires a complete scan of the surrounding airspace.

### 64.
**Answer: c. On most flights other than flights from a low slope or training hill that are not high enough for a successful deployment**

Reserves should be carried on most flights except very low training flights.

### 65.
**Answer: a, b, c**
